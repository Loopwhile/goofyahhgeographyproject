        <h2>How the capitalists got west germany</h2>
        <p>
          So when Adolph Hitler betrayed russia he happened to be in a fight
          with Great Britan and the United States so when he fought the U.S.S.R
          he ended up fighting a double battle and lost then he commited die.
          This left Germany in shambles so the United States, France, and Great
          Britan got west Germany

      <div id="Blockade">
        <h2>The berlin blockade</h2>
        <p>
          So when communist berlin put up the blockade that stopped the
          capitalists from getting rescouses to capilist berlin until they flew
          a plane even though communist berlin told them they cant and that
          plane didnt get shot down they had also droped candy for the children.
